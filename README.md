Introduce comfyui agent.

I recently came across comfyui and thought it would be nice to have agentui, so I added agent myself.

After using it for a few days, I realized the advantages of this agent

- It reflects the BASE flow nodes in real time and can be directly supervised by the AI.

- It is very informative and comfortable for beginners, and it can answer the explanation of various settings immediately.

- The agent can judge the settings and recommend prompts, connection status, and various numbers.

- It detects flows in real time, so you can immediately identify problems with complex node connections.
